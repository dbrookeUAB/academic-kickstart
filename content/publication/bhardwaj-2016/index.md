abstract: "Bacterial viruses of the P22-like family encode a specialized tail needle essential for genome stabilization after DNA-packaging and implicated in Gram-negative cell envelope penetration. The atomic structure of P22 tail needle (gp26) crystallized at acidic pH reveals a slender fiber containing an N-terminal trimer-of-hairpins tip. Though the length and composition of tail needles vary significantly in Podoviridae, unexpectedly, the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal tip is exceptionally conserved in more than two hundred genomes of P22-like phages and prophages. In this paper, we used X-ray crystallography and EM to investigate the neutral pH structure of three tail needles from bacteriophage P22, HK620 and Sf6. In all cases, we found the N-terminal tip is poorly structured, in stark contrast to the compact trimer-of-hairpins seen in gp26 crystallized at acidic pH. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, limited proteolysis, circular dichroism spectroscopy and gel filtration chromatography revealed that the N-terminal tip is highly dynamic in solution and unlikely to adopt a stable trimeric conformation at physiological pH. This is supported by the cryo-EM reconstruction of P22 mature virion tail, where the density of gp26 N-terminal tip is incompatible with a trimer-of-hairpins. We propose the tail needle N-terminal tip exists in two conformations: a pre-ejection extended conformation, which seals the portal vertex after genome-packaging and a post-ejection trimer-of-hairpins that form upon its release from the virion. The conformational plasticity of the tail needle N-terminal tip is built in the amino acid sequence, explaining its extraordinary conservation in nature."
